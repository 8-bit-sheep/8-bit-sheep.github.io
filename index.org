[[https://twitter.com/sakalli][ Sami Kallinen @sakalli]], aptly titled as the company’s bellwether, is part of the generation who first hacked 8-bit computers in the early 80’s. A seasoned executive with three superpowers — data & AI, visionary leadership, and media. For Sami, transformation is about understanding that everything today is software.
Kallinen founded his first professional online media service almost 25 years ago. For three years he worked in the CDO role at Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, where he was responsible for driving the modernisation of the application architecture, and introducing AI and data platforms early on to the organisation. Later, he worked in the management team of KSF Media for two years with CDO & CTO responsibilities. Sami has implemented radical transformation programmes both in terms of product development and leadership. Since 4 - 5 years ago, when it became apparent that data & AI are both a question of business hygiene and competitive advantage, the subject has very much been at the centre of Sami’s focus.

* “I’m a humanist that dreams of 8-bit sheep.”
That’s how Sami Kallinen, the founder of 8-bit-sheep, introduced himself on Twitter for many years. The company name refers to Philip K. Dick’s classic sci-fi novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
