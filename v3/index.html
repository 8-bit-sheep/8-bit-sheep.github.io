		The company Bellwether

		<div class="sheep"><img src="images/sami_kallinen.jpg"></div>
		Sami is a humanist who dreams of 8-bit sheep. The results of these nightly builds are currently put into practice at 8-bit-sheep, a consultancy that helps companies with digital transformation and putting data & AI into practice. A seasoned executive with three superpowers — data & AI, visionary leadership, and media.
		<br><br>
		Sami founded his first professional online media service nearly 25 years ago. For three years he worked in the CDO role at Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, where he was responsible for driving the modernisation of the application architecture, and introducing AI and data platforms early to the organisation. Later, he worked in the management team of KSF Media for two years with CDO & CTO responsibilities. Sami has implemented radical transformation programmes both in terms of product development and leadership. Since 3 - 4 years ago, when it became apparent that data & AI are both a question of business hygiene and competitive advantage, the subject has very much been at the centre of Sami’s focus.
